# PRODIGY_SD_01

Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.

EXPLANATION:
Input Handling: The program uses a Scanner object to read user input for temperature and the unit of measurement.
Switch Statement: Based on the original unit (C, F, or K), the program calls appropriate conversion methods.
Conversion Methods: Methods like celsiusToFahrenheit, celsiusToKelvin, etc., perform the actual temperature conversions using the respective formulas.
